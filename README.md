# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. 
This is where I start.


## How to load project

Clone or download this repo to your local computer. Open the folder, and open the index.html file in a browser (preferably in Chrome!). You will see a Jasmine test page displaying the tests.
